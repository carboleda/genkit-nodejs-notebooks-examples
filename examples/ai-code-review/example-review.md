      "summary":
 "The code diff for `examples/ai-code-review/index.ts` primarily refactors how the Genkit AI model and prompts are configured.
 It transitions from using `googleAI.model(\"gemini-2.0-flash\")` to the more direct `gemini20Flash
` constant. A significant change involves moving from an inline prompt string to defining and registering an output schema (`ReviewOutputSchema`) and using a named prompt (`ai.prompt(\"codeReview\")`) for code review generation, improving modularity and
 maintainability. Additionally, an unused `test` function has been removed from the file.",
      "suggestions": [
        {
          "suggestion": "Define the `codeReview` prompt explicitly using `ai.definePrompt
` to specify its template and input variables.",
          "reason": "The diff introduces `ai.prompt(\"codeReview\")` and comments out the old inline prompt. While this is a good refactoring, the definition of the `codeReview` prompt (its template and input variables like `fileName`, `file
Extension`, `diff`) is not shown in this diff. For clarity and reusability, ensure this prompt is properly defined using `ai.definePrompt` with its full template and input schema.",

        },
        {
          "suggestion": "Either uncomment the usage
 of the `response` variable (e.g., for logging the full response after stream completion) or remove `response` from the destructuring if it's not intended to be used.",
          "reason": "The `response` variable is destructured from the `ai.generateStream` call, but
 its usage (the `console.log`) is commented out. This leaves an unused variable.",
          "line": 70
        },
        {
          "suggestion": "Confirm that the removal of the `test` function does not hinder local testing or debugging efforts, or ensure its functionality has been
 properly integrated elsewhere if it was still relevant.",
          "reason": "The `test` function, which appeared to be a utility for gathering git diffs, was entirely removed. If this function served as a useful debugging tool, local testing utility, or a reference, its removal might impact the development workflow if its
 functionality hasn't been migrated or replaced.",
